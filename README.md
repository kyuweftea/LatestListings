A movie discovery app as part of the "Developing Android Apps" course on Udacity.

To use this app, you must create the following resource file:
app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml

This file must contain a string resource with the name "TMDbAPIKEY". Example contents:

/*
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="TMDbAPIKEY">myAPIKEY</string>
</resources>
*/

Get your own API key by creating an account at themoviedb.org and requesting one.

Recommended: add this file to yoiur .gitignore file to prevent someone else from using your key.
